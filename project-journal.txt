  - confirm next steps
roles: research and discussion on best approaches moving forward


Meeting 19.11.25
Participants: Raaghav Sawhney, Milena Nastin, Shreya Shah, Ritik Saxena, Qiming Nie
  - choose which version to merge into main for the testing
  - waiting with the next steps for the real QREL file
roles: Ritik - Initial testing on QREL Part 1, obtained a baseline MAP score of 0.2326, which guided subsequent optimisation work.

Meeting 26.11.25
Participants: Raaghav Sawhney, Milena Nastin, Shreya Shah, Ritik Saxena, Qiming Nie
  - Discussed different approaches for improving the solution: boosting, expansion etc.
  - Agreed on further individual testing and tuning while maintating stable communication to optimise the workflow
roles: Raaghav - ideas for optimisation, everyone - assigned the task of attempting improvements to the existing code

Meeting 1.12.25
Participants: Raaghav Sawhney, Milena Nastin, Shreya Shah, Ritik Saxena, Qiming Nie
  - Split the report writing
  - Assign research tasks and assembling literature review
  - Settle on the final code version
roles: Milena - report document creation and section split, everyone - assigned sections of the report to write, revise once everyone is done

Meeting 3.12.25
Participants: Raaghav Sawhney, Shreya Shah, Qiming Nie
  - Finalize the model which we were going to utilize
  - Start editing the report, suggest changes to each others work


The Implementation Contributions:
*Note: all members of the team attempted different approaches, we picked the one that worked best in the end
Raaghav Sawhney: Create the kstem analyzer, utilize the rm3 model for query expansion, optimizing on the custom idf formula for entity recognition, providing the indexer and the searcher as the base source code for the development.
Shreya Shah: attempt 1: Implemented a custom analyzer with layered filtering and dual stemming, integrate a multi-corpus indexer for the TREC collections, and execute BM25-driven topic retrieval through a boosted multi-field query parser. - approach abandoned 
             attempt 2: Using a simple English analyzer with stemming and stopword removal, index multiple document collections into Lucene, and run boosted searches on title, description, and narrative to generate top results for each topic in TREC format. - score was not as good as expected
Milena Nastin: created the base code for the indexer and searcher, which was later used in all of the other implementations; attempted improvements by creating a custom analyzer and a hybrid scoring approach
Qiming Nie: Primarily responsible for developing and integrating LMDirichlet-based retrieval models within the shared Lucene codebase, and implementing related pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) experiments. Parameter scans were conducted on the μ parameter, number of feedback documents, number of expansion terms, and interpolation weights, with the optimal configuration applied to the final submitted system.
Ritik Saxena: Performed initial QREL testing, generating the baseline MAP score (0.2326) used to benchmark all improvements, and Contributed iterative
updates to the indexer and searcher during later development phases. Assisted in running, validating, and debugging large experiment batches.


The Report Contributions:
Raaghav Sawhney: Contributed to the Abstract,Introduction,Implementation,Experimental Setup,Helped in providing literature for Relevant Work,Evaluating models and analysers with parameter sweeping, Conclusion.
Shreya Shah: Contributed to Abstract, Introduction and writing the content for the Relevant Work
Milena Nastin: Created the first draft of thr conclusion, contributed to the Experimental setup and Evaluation sections, created a parameter sweeping script
Qiming Nie: Drafted and refined the evaluation sections pertaining to analyzers, retrieval models, and query formulas; analyzed and summarized the results of parameter sweep experiments.
Ritik Saxena: Contributed to writing the Experimental Setup and System Design sections of the report. I also reviewed the overall report and helped ensure the content was clear, consistent, and well-structured.
